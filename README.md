Design Pages Concept
====================

A concept for a way to organize and share design assets using GitHub.

## The App

The master branch of this repository is a newly generated Rails app. This is where the application code would go.

## The Designs

Design work is stored on the branch "design-pages".

## Why no GitHub pages?

GitHub pages are great but always public, even if your repository is private. Design assets shared during a build project often need to be private.
